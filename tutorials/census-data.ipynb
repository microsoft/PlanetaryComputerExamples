    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will explore various subsets of geographic data in the [United States 2020 Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-main.html). You will learn how the data is structured and how to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of two groups:\n",
    "1. **Census data by census block boundaries**: This group contains data for each census block, grouped by US counties. Census blocks are the smallest available unit made available by the US Census Bureau. This group also includes population totals broken down by census block, available in a second table.\n",
    "2. **Census data by cartographic boundaries**: This group contains data that is aggregated by 29 different geographic boundaries, ranging from block groups to regional datasets such as metropolitan divisions and states. This group does not include any demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains details about all geographic datasets within the 2020 census data. Use the table of contents to jump to any section relevant to you.

    "The second block of data is organized by different cartographic categories. These boundaries cover larger areas than the individual census blocks discussed [above](#Census-data-by-census-block-boundaries). The different categories range from census block groups (consisting of several census blocks) all the way up to a National Boundary file (encompassing the entire USA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The files in this second group tend to be smaller in size than the census block data in the first group. Therefore, the files in the second group are not partitioned into multiple files, and each dataset only consists of one parquet file. Another difference is that the datasets in this second group include different information than the census block files in the first group and do not contain population statistics. Which additional data is included differs from dataset to dataset. See [Appendix E. in the 2020 TIGER/Line Technical Documentation](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2020/TGRSHP2020_TechDoc.pdf) for more details on the available feature classes.\n",

Each example uses the same basic workflow and dependencies as the [Census Block Boundaries](#Census-data-by-census-block-boundaries) for the first group of data. An important thing to note when using this data is that before plotting the data onto a basemap, the datasets need to be converted to Web Mercator [(EPSG 3857)](https://epsg.io/3857) using the [to_crs](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html) function of [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/).\n",
