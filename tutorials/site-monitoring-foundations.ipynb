    "Monitoring landscapes over time can help detect crop stress, measure snow cover changes, or identify wildfire recovery. This notebook is your starting point for learning how to track those changes using Microsoft’s Planetary Computer platform. In this foundational notebook, you'll define an area of interest, query satellite imagery from the Open Planetary Computer (OPC), apply indices like NDVI, and identify changes across a time series.\n",
    "The goal is to help you understand key remote sensing concepts and build hands-on skills for real-world geospatial monitoring.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧭 **Understand the purpose** of satellite-based site monitoring.\n",
    "- 🛰 **Define and import an Area of Interest (AOI)** for analysis.\n",
    "- 📦 **Retrieve** Earth observation data using the STAC API.\n",
    "- 🧮 **Calculate** remote sensing indices (like NDVI) to track change.\n",
    "- 📈 **Visualize and interpret** changes in in your data over time.\n",
    "- 🔍 **Detect** significant changes using thresholds or time-series trends\n",
    "- 🛠 **Export your results** to resuse in tools like Fabric or Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, here are a few key concepts we'll use in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raster data**: Satellite imagery is made up of pixels (grids), each with numeric values representing the Earth's surface.\n",
    "- **Bands**: Satellite images contain multiple spectral bands—each measuring light reflected at specific wavelengths (e.g., Red, Near-Infrared).\n",
    "- **NDVI**: A vegetation index calculated using the red and near-infrared bands. Higher values typically indicate healthy vegetation.\n",
    "- **Area of Interest (AOI)**: A polygon or boundary that defines where you're monitoring.\n",
    "- **Timeseries**: A sequence of observations (images) over time for your AOI.\n",
    "- **[STAC](https://stacspec.org/en)**: A standard for searching and describing satellite imagery and geospatial data.\n",
    "- **Planetary Computer**: A catalog of open datasets we’ll query using STAC.\n",
    "\n",

    "### ❄️ Interpreting NDSI Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)** is a powerful tool for identifying snow cover in satellite imagery by comparing reflectance in the green and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands.  \n",
    "Snow is typically **bright in the green band** and **absorptive in the SWIR band**, leading to high NDSI values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thresholds and Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting NDSI values isn't always straightforward — thresholds can vary depending on:\n",
    "- **land cover** (e.g., forested vs. open terrain),\n",
    "- **illumination and sensor angle**,\n",
    "- **scene conditions** (e.g., snow under cloud shadow or mixed with vegetation).\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, commonly used guidelines include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| NDSI Value Range | Interpretation                            |\n",
    "|------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| > **0.4**         | Likely **snow-covered** surface           |\n",
    "| 0.2 – 0.4         | Possibly **mixed snow** or patchy areas   |\n",
    "| 0.0 – 0.2         | Bare ground or dry soil                   |\n",
    "| < **0.0**         | Water, vegetation, or cloud shadow        |\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not hard rules — think of them as **decision aids** rather than strict classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we include horizontal reference lines on the NDSI time series plot to help guide interpretation.  \n",
    "However, if your AOI is forested, coastal, or mountainous, it may be worth adjusting the snow threshold or inspecting example scenes visually for validation."

    "## ✅ Next Steps\n",

    "This notebook introduced the core concepts of time-series monitoring using Sentinel-2 imagery and NDSI to detect snow cover over a user-defined area and date range.\n",

    "### 💡 Other ideas to try:\n",
    "- Use NDVI to monitor vegetation changes before/after snow cover\n",
    "- Compare results across different years to study seasonal patterns\n",
    "- Apply thresholds to detect persistent snow vs. transient snowfall\n",
    "- Export your xarray dataset for visualization in other GIS tools\n",
