    "The reason we choose to use GeoPandas is that it allows us to handle points, lines, curves and polygons (a.k.a., [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)). \n",
    "Then we can reference these shapes, packed with their own associated data, to a [Coordinate Reference System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system) (CRS). \n",
    "Under CRS, you will often find different [EPSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset) codes which represent different projections of our planet. \n",
    "This way, GeoPandas allows us to scale into delimiting areas on a map which are loaded with our data.\n",
