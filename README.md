# Planetary Computer Examples

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that serve as examples of using the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycompture.microsoft.com) data, APIs and Hub.

## Getting Started

This project uses Docker to encapsulate the development environment. To set up your development
environment, have Docker installed and run:

```
> scripts/setup
```

If you need to rebuild the images at any point, you
can run:

```
> scripts/update
```

To run the jupyter notebook server, you can use:

```
> scripts/server
```

And browse to the URL printed in the terminal output.

From there you'll be able to run all Jupyter Notebook examples.
